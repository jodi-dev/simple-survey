# simple-survey
SEG3125 Lab 1

Design a survey about a UI (linked to).

## Criteria

• A title (<title> tag)
• A link to the website of your choice (where the UI to be evaluated is)
• An image of the website you are evaluating which also serves as a link to the website.
• A form (<form> tag) containing at least 5 questions using the following types listed below:
    • A text type question (e.g. user must type in the answer)
    • A single choice question (radio button)
    • A single choice question (single selection list)
    • A multi-selection type question (several boxes can be selected)
    • A place to write comments.
• A button to submit the questionnaire.
• Your signature (Website designed by ...) at the bottom of the page also known as a footer. It
does not need to be your real name... take an artist name!
• The use of divisions (<div> tag with associated CSS style) to make the questions uniform.
• Using external CSS (separate file) to define styles for titles, divisions, your signature at the
bottom of the page, etc. Explore styling for fonts, colors, alignments, etc.

## Inspirations

- [Survey Results by Anna Kukhareva](https://dribbble.com/shots/10181096-Survey-Results): I like the grey background with the white paper-like section in the middle, it's like having an A4 piece of paper survey. I want to add top nav and footer. Overall I like how simple and clean it is, especially the color palette.

- [Jusdo- New Sales Analytics Dashboard by Sreerag Nath](https://dribbble.com/shots/5805036-Jusdo-New-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard): I like the colour-blind friendly color palette.

- [Fullscreen Form/Surey by Bonnie Mercer](https://dribbble.com/shots/7095805-Fullscreen-Form-Survey): Again I love the simple layout. I won't use separate pages for different questions because I don't want to route, but I do want to somehow section off each question.

- [Hippocrates—Test Page by Arsen Kolyba](https://dribbble.com/shots/7913688-Hippocrates-Test-Page): I like the big header region, I could delineate a section like this to introduce the link/image of the UI to criticize.
